# LeetCode
You can find here the codes that I have been using to practice.
I'm not an expert in coding, just an empiric learner that just started.


Disclaimer: There are many examples I couldn't solve, so I took some ideas from other pages or videos that I will put at the begining of the code.
Solutions here are not optimal in several cases, don't trust them
